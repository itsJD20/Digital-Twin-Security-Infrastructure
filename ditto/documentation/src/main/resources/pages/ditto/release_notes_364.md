#### Fix missing headers from message after js mapper

#### Fixed creating a thing with PATCH / merge containing null values used the null values for the new Thing

Issue [#2074](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/2074) reported a bug where the defined semantics of a 
[PATCH / merge](protocol-specification-things-merge.html) referring to the [JSON merge patch RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) 
was not correctly implemented, as `null` values in the Thing were not deleted (as defined in the RFC), but were used
for the created thing JSON. This was fixed in PR [#2082](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/pull/2082).
